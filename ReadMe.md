Quick Sample code for interviews. 
 


I've used the following Nugets Dapper and CSVHelper, Dapper because it's a good ORM that I'm used to and CSVHelper to make the creation of the CSV file faster

Things that I would improve on this project would be: 
More unit tests
Instead of saving the file to server(where application is) use a PushstreamResponse and return the export to the caller of the API. 


Database belongs to the company that asked me to make this sample. And I no longer have it.
